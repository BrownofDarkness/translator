If you came here for Hacktoberfest, you're in the right place ü¶áÔ∏è:

Celebrate [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) by getting involved in the open source community by completing some tasks in this project.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

[HacktoberFest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is digitalocean‚Äôs annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout october. Much of modern tech infrastructure‚Äîincluding some of digitalocean‚Äôs own products‚Äîrelies on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often don‚Äôt have the staff or budgets to do much more than keep the project alive. HacktoberFest is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source, especially the people that make open source so special.

This repository is open to all members of the GitHub community. Any member may contribute to this project without being a collaborator.
